I think I have the data uploaded, but I could not remember the exact format you need. In general: 

heart.pts -> point cloud of heart geometry
	-geometry mesh
act_maps -> activation data for the point cloud for each simulation. 
	-as Brett's potential fields
results.txt -> has the data for the simulation (CC, and L2norm) as well as the simulation name 
design.txt -> matrix for the design parameters that matches the simulation name 

Let me know how I can format it differently or anything. It may be a lot larger because it is a whole point cloud of a heart instead of the surface. 



bar charts:
 t,z,phi,the CC and the L2 norm

 design matrix, txt file ,matrix format for simulation names. columns correspond to the simulation names of (t, z,phi,p, cv, n)
